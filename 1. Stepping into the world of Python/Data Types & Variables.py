# Create a variable in Python - so assign a name to the container of the info
# The following is like an example of Macro Variables (%let) in SAS scripting
# example
character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"

print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old.")
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age)

## Types of Data
# A string is basically plain text, such as Name - aka stuff inside quotation marks much like SAS

# A number is stored (again like SAS)  without the quotation marks
# Example
My_Age = 27
My_Salary = 60237.57

# Can also store a boolean value (i.e. True or False values)
# Example of boolean
Is_Male = True
